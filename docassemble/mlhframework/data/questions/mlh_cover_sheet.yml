# Used to set up and populate a dynamic ALDocument cover page, which can then be
# included in a tool's ALDocumentBundle.
# Can be included in a form packet's ALDocumentBundle as either an individual file or along
# with instructions or other reference material. The below examples are from the child support motion 
# tool and therefore list other child support docs and a child support filename.
# 1. As individual file, include the cover_sheet object in al_user_bundle in your interview.

#      - al_user_bundle: ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[cover_sheet_template_2, mrcs_attachment,

#        Forms).pdf", title="All forms to download for your records", enabled=True)
# 2. As part of a combined file ('instructions' is an ALDocument defined locally. The cover_sheet 
#    template is inserted into the 'instructions' template. See coding doc for more info.):
